## Technologies Used

- [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) &mdash; wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. Equipped with nothing but an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer.

- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) &mdash; is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) &mdash; makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
